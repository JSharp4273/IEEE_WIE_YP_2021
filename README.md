# IEEE_WIE_YP_2021 

This repository contains the files and exemples presented during the IEEE Women In Engineering (WIE) and IEEE Young Professional (YP) events of december 2021.

In the folder about the Deep Learning application, the models sub-folder does not currently contains the weights of the networks.
This is due to the size of files.
You can downloads the module OpenCV Extra : https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra
In OpenCV's Extra find the folder named "dnn".
Then execute the python script "download_models.py"
The weights file for Mask-RCNN is named : _mask_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28.pb_
The weights file for YoloV3 is named : _yolov3.weights_
